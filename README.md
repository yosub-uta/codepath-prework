## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Google Map
- Continuous scrolling
- Zoom in 
- Search by categories (e.g., food)

2. Instagram
- Continuous scrolling
- Undoing previous actions such as "Like"

3. Yelp
- Reviews by stars
- Search by categories (e.g., food)
- Continuous scrolling


My app idea is called "LinguaLoop," a language learning platform that leverages the power of storytelling and community engagement. Unlike traditional flashcard-based apps, LinguaLoop immerses users in interactive stories filled with authentic dialogue and cultural context. Users progress through the story by choosing dialogue options, earning points for correct choices and unlocking new chapters.

Key features:

- Branching narratives: Stories adapt based on user choices, offering personalized learning experiences and replayability.
- Collaborative storytelling: Users can contribute their own chapters, building a diverse library of stories and fostering a creative community.
- Built-in dictionary and grammar reference: Seamless access to language tools within the story context, removing the need for context switching.

## Notes

No challenges. Thanks for a helpful guide.
